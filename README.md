# RESTful-API

Crafted a robust and customizable RESTful API to facilitate seamless interaction with a Student Registration System. This API, built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose, streamlines the management of student data. It empowers users to perform essential CRUD operations, including the creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of student records, all of which can be effortlessly executed through Postman.

The system stores student information in a structured JSON format within MongoDB, ensuring data integrity and accessibility. Furthermore, the API provides the flexibility to update student records via the PATCH method, offering a holistic solution for efficiently managing student registration and data maintenance.

Here's the tech stack I employed for this project:

JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.
